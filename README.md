# Never GiveUp Club - Igniting the Passion of the Running Community

This project has been meticulously crafted as part of the immersive learning content at the [Code Institute](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org). The lion's share of the code was initially authored by Code Institute as a walkthrough project, and was then fully coded and enhanced by `Frank Arellano` to fulfill the assignment, who took inspiration from the comprehensive final lesson on CSS & HTML.

This README isn't as extensive as my previous personal projects, visible at [Plexo Projects](https://github.com/plexoio?tab=stars), since this endeavor is primarily educational. However, I've added my own unique touches, enhancing the layout, styling, and adding some distinct features compared to the project showcased at Code Institute.

The custom features I've incorporated include:

- Hover Effects
- Smooth Animations
- Innovative Layout Design
- Engaging Content
- Strategic Use of Keywords
- Responsive Design via Media Queries

Furthermore, I've incorporated an offline Fontawesome kit (current version V6.4.0, released March 2023) to enrich the visual appeal of the project.

Rest assured, the code has been meticulously indented and has undergone thorough validation using `HTML & CSS validator`, ensuring a clean, optimized, and error-free codebase.

This current iteration is designed exclusively for learning and demonstration purposes. While it's fully functional and ready for use, it is not available for public deployment.
